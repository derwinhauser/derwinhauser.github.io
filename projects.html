                                    Developed a JavaFX application that analyzes blackjack games based on customizable casino rules, calculating player vs. house edge and key statistics such as expected value per hand, variance, player edge, risk of ruin, and average bet size. The application features a user-friendly interface with input forms, real-time bankroll charts, and a progress bar for long simulations, enabling efficient simulation of thousands of shoes while keeping the UI responsive. Built using Java and Maven.

                                <td>Developed an interactive computer vision game, Cake Pop Demon Hunters, using Python and OpenCV. The game uses real-time webcam input to detect player movement and face position, allowing players to defend against attacking demons. Players eliminate corner demons by moving in front of them and must avoid falling demons that descend from the top of the screen. The application features dynamic gameplay with motion-based controls, real-time scoring, and a game-over system, providing a responsive and immersive experience.</td>
